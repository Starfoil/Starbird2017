# starbird-project ![titlebanner][logo]

**Lastest Release : 1.2 | 2017-05-29**

### About
Starbird is a personal Java-based 2D-shooter game that I started back in highschool, recently going back to it in May 2017.
Over the years, I've started to implement more functionality to the game as my programming skills expanded, using git as the project's version control.

### Usage
The project is exported through a .jar file which can be simply executed as long as you have Java installed on your system. Find the latest release above. There's no need for further installation.

### Game overview
You play as a bird trying to take down other birds and get as much points as possible. Over the levels, you collects coins to buy better skins and upgrade your character so you can further progress to more difficult levels. Indeed, a very cliche arcade-rpg game.
