# Starbird-project
**Lastest Release : 1.2**
### About
Starbird is a personal Java-based 2D-shooter game that I started back in highschool. Over the years, I've started to implement
more functionality to the game as my programming skills expanded, using git as the project's version control.

### Usage
The project is exported through a .jar file which can simply be executed as long as you have Java installed on your system. Find the latest release above.
