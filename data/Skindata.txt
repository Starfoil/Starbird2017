Let's face the fact, nobody wants to be a normie. Nobody really. We all know being a normie 
sucks but what else can you do? Surely you can get a job, maybe some make some friends for a 
start but let's be honest, tackling such demanding tasks can be far from easy. 

Everyday you must fight in uphill battle to stay relevant in society but even then, what good 
does it do? Perhaps it's time to turn things around and to do that, tables are going to need 
to be flipped, and even for that you're going to need some strong hands.

The school's #1 flying ace, picking up gold in every competition he's been in there's little
wonder as to why the school's president has named him honour student of the year and has
his picture posted across campus using his distinguished rep as a sully way to raise the
school's enrollment. Rumours also has it that the school's comittee has proposed a vote to
ban him from all further competition in an attempt to level the playing field.

If you're tired of eating dust then look no further as Lightning McQueen got you covered but
as speed surely has it uses, it also has its limitation as you're going to need fast fingers
and a decent APM to survive and maintain your title as Red Baron.

The beast himself, boasting a 60% damage reduction it's no wonder they call him Big Puff
back in flight school. This guy always brings his lunch to school and never hesitates to
eat yours. We're talking about the guy who needs both doors open and takes up both seats
on the bus. Sounds familar to you, he's also the same guy that you'll likely never see hit
the gym. 

His years spent at the local internet cafe has got him lacking in the speed department, but
have no worries as his excessive calories quickly makes up for it because honestly, why need
speed when you got nothing to run from. So put aside your APM as you surely can't go 
wrong with this tanky beast and tell your buddies on hop on your back as you facetank the 
crap out of everything.

With those flamming new looks and super hot style, one can see this guy got all brand new
kicks for school. Some say he's so lit even his teachers call him Super Hot Fire while
other shrug it off in envy. But just saying, this dude leaves a fiery trial everywhere he 
goes and the girls are always hot on his tail.

Asisdes, everybody knows being a fiend can be a daunting task but this guy makes it look easy 
with his fiendish qualities making him your go-to-guy for sustained DPS and all around balanced 
stats. But off with a fair warning, will looking slick really help you survive what's to come?

Let's be honest here. Angry Birds is dead, nobody needs to say that twice, and it won't be 
coming back anytime soon.

We can all agree its glory days are long over. Now it stands nothing more than a reminiscence
of the old days. No longer can you find it trending on the App Store nor anywhere else really. 
I guess we all just have to face the fact that its time has long passed and it has been sent 
to the underworld of dead apps where it aimlessly lingers on with other souls such as Flappy 
Bird.

Plus, wasn't there an Angry Birds movie or something?

Ahh, who knows, and who cares!

LIFE. FORM. DISINTEGRATION. RAY.

Must they always flee?

I open my eye wide and unleash a beam of energy, following the escaping creatures. 
They are instantly reduced to ash. "Hmm. Void-native melting point is inconsistent," I note.

But that is of no consequence. The hunger inside me grows. I am ravenous. Insatiable, 
as never before.

I have glimpsed the ultimate knowledge.

And I will have it.

Let's hope you still got that mystery gift as you're going to need to go to Birth Island.
Oh and did I mention, you can't obtain that anymore. So wait, how did you get Deoxy then?
Surely nothing adds up here and the answer is fairly certain, you're probably just a 
big cheater. Sigh... stealing your mom's credit card to secretly purchase yourself some
GameShark and Action Replays.

You should definetly be ashamed of yourself really but nevertheless you got yourself one
of the strongest monsters in the game. So go ahead and pat yourself on the back, because
surely nobody's watching.

The only thing left for you to do now is cruise through the lanes of easy street, dragon clawing

Anyhow, lets hope you kept your master ball this time...

Sum, the Dragonslayer

Sum was one of Lord Begerius's most trusted knights, and one of the first men to
get knighted by the throne. Believed to be the captain to the Chrononauts of the
round table, Sum was granted royal pardon over his past demeanors involving minors.

Troubled by his past and determined to vindicate his wrongdoings, Sum undertook a
task in which no other would dare, to shed the blood of a living dragon and claim
its head, a task he was barely able to manage before he was viciously wounded.

It is unclear as to how Sum survived the battle against Dragonamy but whispers from
the outside has it that Sum has now assembled an army of crusaders to the West and is
ready to take up arms against the dragon once more in hopes of truly slaying it this
time.

Dequan, the Electrified

One day walking back from school Dequan stumbled into a freak accident where an
electrical transformer fell onto the ground alongside live wires instantly frying
everyone unfortunate enough to be caught under the wires, everyone but Dequan.

Days later when he woke up from his coma, he felt jolts of energy running through
his veins. Thinking it was only due to the medication and painkillers he was given, 
Dequan paid it no attention and quickly returned home when he was fully recovered.

Soon enough, he had come to realize he now possesses superhuman power through the means
of electricity. The accident has granted him the power to store and discharge large
amounts of electric energy, a power he soon comes to relish as he starts to cleanse 
society from ones in which he has come to hate most, N's...

Samumind, the First Ronin

Having the impeccable mind of a true samurai, Samumind was destined to climb the
ranks of the Ancient Masters. Soon as he ascended his way up, he was shunned and
ousted by his own clan in fear that he would grow stronger than his own masters.

Having been stabbed in the back by his own, Samumind would not let their betrayal
slip away. Returning to his clan, Samumind entered his old palace with blade in hand,
where he condemned their disloyalty and challenged his lord master to a duel as
retribution. When the lord refused, Samumind named him a coward and struck him down
in front of his very brothers. 

Appalled by their lord's murder, the palace took up arms against Samumind and
a battle ensued. Soon after dusk as the sound of steel slowly died out around
the palace, it was rumored that only one survived the bloodshed, the very same
one that entered the day.

Impatient to drop his new album, DJ Gr4y has been staying up long hours at night

has already been a smash and took the music industry by storm as it soared up the
music charts.

Now with no sign of stopping, DJ Gr4y has recently leaked some of his upcoming soundtracks
and the fans have already got themselves lining up. With only weeks until the release
of his next mixtape "BGs and Booze", the internet has already predicted its peak to 
number one on the Chart Top 40s and Billboard Top 100s.

Needless to say, his fans absolutely love him and will stop at nothing to get their hands 
on DJ Gr4y's next hot album as it is anticipated to drop in the coming weeks.

Udrew, M.D

After graduating university with doctorate degree in medicine, Udrew went on to complete
medical school where he was then accepted into a neurosurgery program, where he served a
year as a surgical intern and five years in residency, completing his final year as chief
resident.

As a neurosurgeon with skilled hand-eye coordination, he specialized in brain cancer and was
said to be on the brink of a medical breakthrough in cancer research when he was unfortunately
diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in a tragic case of irony. 

With no other options, Udrew tasked his surgical team to daringly perform a task never done 
before, to conduct a full human brain transplant, a procedure that was said to be impossible.
Miraculously, the operation was a success and Udrew was given the healthy brain of a patient
by the name of Nelson Gao.

Years after his extraordinary survival with neuroblastoma, Udrew now works at the local 
elementary school as a full-time lunch room supervisor and when asked if he had any regrets
in life, he simply smiled and said no.
